# Remote Sensing RGB Image Dehazing

*B.Sc. thesis*

The development of remote sensing methods makes it possible to use this data to solve the tasks of precision farming.
    However, remote sensing images are often degraded by suspended aerosol in the air. 
    The aim of the work is to develop and analyze an algorithm of single image dehazing, that is a crucial and indispensable pre-processing step in remote sensing image processing.
    Particular attention is paid to color distortion of corresponding dehazed images.
    In the work, some image enhancement methods were analyzed, the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm and its modifications were analyzed in detail, aerial photography data were reviewed, and an experimental study of the proposed algorithms was carried out.
